Input Data Set should be integers sets (example: products codes) and they are recorded as one by one in the "InputDataSet.txt"

Ex:
1901778
1901802
1904028
1904317
1909324
1910231

Python program reorganized the data set into horizontal lines. Each line includes the 5o products which are seperated by the comma.
